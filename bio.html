          <h1>About Canwen Xu</h1>
          <p>Hi, I'm Canwen. This is my author website <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/my-website-is-ugly-because-i-made-it/">that I created</a>, so I'm not going to bother writing in the third person. In the spring of 2022 I started working on a piece of fiction about a senior at Columbia who faces a rejection so debilitating that it makes her question the most fundamental things that she believes about herself. Some of the story was based on real things that happened to me, but most of it was not. Four years, 25ish drafts, and an entire genre change later, this novel will be published under the name BORING ASIAN FEMALE. Writing this novel was somehow the hardest and the easiest thing I've ever done, and wouldn't have been possible without an entire village: my agent, editors, friends & family. Anyway, it would mean a lot to me if you pre-ordered the book. And if you don't feel like buying it but still want to read the story, consider borrowing a copy from a friend or the library once it's out in the universe in April 2026. :) </p>
